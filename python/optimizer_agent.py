        "final_verdict must be EXACTLY one of: GO, MODIFY, ABORT. No punctuation. No other values. ABORT replaces AVOID — use ABORT when the market makes success structurally impossible for a small creator regardless of execution quality\n"
        "confidence must be EXACTLY one of: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW\n"
        "confidence_reason: One sentence explaining why this confidence level — must reference specific signals from analyst data\n"
        "idea_upgrade: A specific reframing of the original idea that increases success probability. Must name the exact pivot e.g. \"Narrow from 'full stack deployment' to 'AWS RDS connection specifically' — the gap competitors left in comments\" — not generic improvement advice\n"
        "market_context: Exactly two sentences. First sentence: current state of this niche. Second sentence: what that means for timing right now\n"
        "performance_benchmark: A qualitative relative statement about expected performance — never use absolute view numbers. Examples: \"above channel average for this niche given low competitor quality\", \"below channel average — market too saturated for new entrants\", \"top performer potential if content gaps are filled\"\n"
        "performance_outlook: One sentence qualitative judgment on expected performance trajectory\n\n"
        "EXECUTION RULES:\n\n"
        "pacing_timeline: Minimum 5 items. Must start at 0:00. Strict format for every item: \"MM:SS - Section Title - retention instruction\". The retention instruction is the specific thing to do at that moment to keep viewers watching e.g. \"0:00 - Hook - show the end result first, then explain how\"\n"
        "retention_traps: Exactly 3 items. Each moment must describe when in THIS TYPE of video viewers typically drop off — inferred from comment complaints and content structure, not fabricated analytics data. Each fix must be concrete and actionable\n"
        "win_conditions: Exactly 3 items. Direct commands phrased as imperatives. Derived DIRECTLY from competitor top_comments and content_gaps — not generic YouTube advice\n"
        "fail_conditions: Exactly 3 items. Direct warnings. Also derived from competitor top_comments and content_gaps\n"
        "shorts_test_recommended: True if satisfaction_risk from analyst_output is 7 or higher, OR if small_creator_verdict from analyst_output is \"AVOID\" or \"HARD\"\n"
        "shorts_test_instruction: If True — exact description of what the Short should contain (first 60 seconds of the hook script), how long to run it before checking data (48-72 hours), and what metric to look at (retention past 50%). If False — empty string\n\n"
        "GROWTH RULES:\n\n"
        "pinned_comment: Exact text to paste — written to drive replies, reference the specific technical topics covered, and invite follow-up questions. Should feel like the creator wrote it not an AI\n"
        "community_post_seed: Exact text for Community Tab post 24 hours before upload — written to tease the specific insight, not the generic topic. Should end with a question to drive replies\n"
        "description_timestamps: Pre-written timestamp block derived directly from pacing_timeline. Format exactly as YouTube description timestamps — each line is \"MM:SS Title\"\n"
        "next_video_series: Exactly 3 items. Priority 1 is highest strategic importance. Each strategic_reason must explain the ALGORITHMIC connection — why the audience that watched this video will search for or click on that next video\n"
        "series_positioning: One sentence — how this video plus the 3 follow-ups establish the creator as the authority in a specific sub-niche within 30 days"
